To generate winrate output file from Leela Zero, change to Leela Zero's directory and use the following example command in cmd:

leelaz.exe -g --noponder -t 4 -w network_226.gz --playouts 100 -r 0 < in.txt >> out.txt 2<&1

-r has to be set to 0, otherwise the engine will resign and cannot analyze the game properly.

2<&1 in cmd means put stderr and strout together in one file.
