AB & AW: place stones for either black or white. (Before the game starts)
Example:
AW[dd][dp]AB[pp][fq]AW[nq][nc]AB[pd][fc]

B & W: play moves for either black or white
Example:
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[nq];B[fc];W[nc]

Coordinate Transformation: transform the coordinates in an application into sgf coordinates
Example:

Application Coordinates --> SGF Coordinates
Black plays Q16 --> ;B[pd]
White plays D4 --> ;W[dp]

We call Q, D and p, d as the x-coordinates, 16, 4 and d, p as the y coordinates.

What is worth noting is that the coordinates in most Go board application (e.g Sabaki) does not have "I" as the x coordinate, but sgf does.

X Coordinates transformation:

App --> SGF

A --> a

B --> b

C --> c

...

H --> h

(No "I" as x coordinates in application)

J --> i

K --> j

L --> k

...

T --> s

Y Coordinates transformation:

App --> SGF

19 --> a

18 --> b

17 --> c

...

1 --> s

Branches: use () to indicate them.

Example:

(;W[cn];B[jp])(;W[nq](;B[fc];W[nc])(;B[cn];W[fc]))
