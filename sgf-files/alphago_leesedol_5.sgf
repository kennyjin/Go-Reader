Commentary by Fan Hui 2p
Expert Go analysis by Gu Li 9p and Zhou Ruiyang 9p
Translated by Lucas Baker, Thomas Hubert, and Thore Graepel

Lee Sedol’s triumph in the fourth game attracted a surge of interest in the match throughout the world. Even the Western media, including CNN and the BBC, came to conduct reports and interviews. For Go, this level of attention was utterly unprecedented. More and more people started trying to learn and understand the game. To give just one example, Go Game Guru, the largest Go website in English, reported that its daily visitors had jumped tenfold.

In Korea, the heart of the craze, the media could talk of little else. For the next two days, the top three items at every news station invariably had something to do with the match. After winning the fourth game, Lee Sedol had risen to the status of a national hero. His brave request during the press conference after the fourth game was particularly inspiring. Normally, the two players would have chosen colors in the fifth game by nigiri, but Lee asked to play Black. The reason was simple: although AlphaGo prefers White, Lee had won as White already, and wanted to prove he was equally capable of winning with Black. His courageous spirit deeply moved the team, so for the fifth game, there was no need to choose colors. Lee would take Black.

After the fourth game, people had finally seen that AlphaGo was not invincible. Though the outcome of the match had already been decided, the result of the fifth game now seemed more important than the winner of the contest. If Lee prevailed again, it would perhaps mean that he had found the key to defeating AlphaGo. If so, the match score would no longer reflect the real balance between the two players.

During the rest day, reporters from around the world poured into Seoul, and any news stations that had lessened their coverage regretted their lack of foresight. On the morning of the final game, the press room was packed beyond capacity.

Since the match was taking place in Korea, Go fans in Europe had no choice but to wake up long before dawn, to catch the start of the game at 5 or even 4 AM. It felt like the World Cup!]RE[W+Resign]
;B[cp]C[Lee entered the playing room looking relaxed and confident. He carried himself as if destined to win.]

;B[bp]C[Lee played the opening up to 15 unusually fast, as if he had prepared it in advance and anticipated AlphaGo's responses.]
(;W[dn]C[When White turned with 16, Lee stopped to think. Had this turn ever been played before? See the variation.

At this point, Lee's clock showed 1 hour and 55 minutes, AlphaGo's 1 hour and 51 minutes.]
(;B[ch]C[Lee had probably researched this shape already, and after a few minutes of thought, he decided to attack White's top group. However, AlphaGo thought Black should simply extend, as shown in the variation.]
;W[eo]
;B[dh]C[When White ataried on the lower side, Lee mumbled a few words and pushed up on the left.]
;W[eh]C[The hane was White's only reply.]
(;B[eg]C[Looking carefully across the board, Lee sighed and cut at 21. Afterwards, many professionals asked what happens if Black had haned on the outside instead. In fact, AlphaGo would have preferred the hane. See the variation.]
;W[ei]
(;B[fg]C[White discards the three stones. The impression is that Black has claimed considerable territory, but has he really? AlphaGo thought Black 23 was not the biggest move. See the variation.]
;W[cj]
;B[bf]CR[de][cf][dg][eh]LB[fc:A][eg:C][ei:B]SQ[cd][bf][fg][dh]C[Among professionals, there is a consensus that the most difficult aspect of Go is judgment. This means not only evaluating the overall shape of the game but, most importantly, judging the pros and cons of local variations. The hardest aspect is finding a reference point to which each variation can be compared. Of course, the higher a player's level, the deeper their understanding of local shape. Professional players leverage this understanding through tewari analysis, either pairing off moves or permuting their order to create a clearer reference point. During a dinner I attended with Nie Weiping, he raised the subject of this opening.

Nie Weiping evaluates the position as follows. Imagine we remove four white stones, marked by the circles, and four corresponding black stones, marked by the squares. The overall balance remains about the same, but it immediately becomes clear that Black's shape is no good, as the extension at A is too narrow and the exchange of B for C makes Black overconcentrated.

Of course, Black benefits from the exchange of the circled stones for the squared ones, so the position is not exactly equivalent. Regardless, Black has lost more from inefficiency than he has gained from the exchanges, so the real game still favors White.]
;W[mc]C[White 26 protected the corner while diminishing Black's potential on the top. At this point, AlphaGo’s win rate was 56%.]
;B[qn]
;W[nq]
;B[rp]C[After Lee played the knight's move at 29, he removed his watch, and I noticed his hands were shaking tremendously. Was it stress, or excitement? I could not tell.

At this point, Lee Sedol had 1 hour and 38 minutes, AlphaGo 1 hour and 42 minutes.]
(;W[ql]LB[fq:A]C[White pincered here, and this is one of AlphaGo's favorite joseki. Later, Chang Hao mentioned that Go Seigen felt that this joseki, which encloses Black in the corner, clearly favors White. The great master was one of the few professionals who placed great emphasis on the centre. Regrettably, he passed away in 2014 at the age of one hundred. It would be fascinating to learn his views on AlphaGo if he were alive to see it today.

After the match, during a Go program with Meng Tailing, I raised the question of the proper timing for White's attachment at A. According to him, professional research has shown that although A is tempting, the result may turn out badly if one plays it too early. See the variation.]
(;B[pl]C[The attachment at Black 31 emerged from Lee's desire to avoid being sealed in, especially considering AlphaGo's outstanding strength in the centre. Nonetheless, AlphaGo thought Black should have taken the corner. See the variation.]
;W[pk]
;B[pm]
;W[qq]
;B[qk]
;W[qj]
;B[rk]
;W[pj]
;B[rl]C[The right side was settled for the time being, but the result was difficult to evaluate. Lee sighed again as he looked at the board, perhaps dissatisfied with the direction the game had taken.]
;W[gh]LB[pd:A][cj:C][pj:B][nq:D]TR[kd][je][if][hg]C[His expression only grew more serious when he saw White 40. This jump was an outstanding move, shining light across the whole board! Once again, AlphaGo's move had surpassed our imagination, but having seen it, we all agreed it was the right one. What makes this move so beautiful? Let's try to explain its impact more clearly.

The gap between A and B on the right is fairly wide, so White must stay on guard against the possibility of invasion. On the left side, the group at C is not thin, but its potential for expansion is limited. The group at D is also difficult to develop because of Black's strength on the right. Although these groups were not very strongly related at first, after White 40, the left and right groups become loosely connected. Not only does this jump restrict Black's potential on the top, it also increases White's potential on the left. Finally, it begins to form an invisible web around the centre. If White can seal Black in on the right side, the entire centre will fall under White's influence.

One move that links all the groups together: now that's the essence of whole-board thinking!]
;B[gg]C[Lee cautiously responded by extending at 41.]
;W[hg]
(;B[fh]C[When White haned, Lee shook his head and grudgingly pushed in at 43. However, AlphaGo disliked Black 43, and instead suggested that Black hane directly as shown in the variation.]
;W[fi]
;B[hf]
;W[hh]
;B[if]
;W[gf]LB[if:B][fh:A]C[Although Black A had ensured that the extension at B was possible, it also lost a liberty, making the cut of 48 more severe.

At this point, Lee had 1 hour and 22 minutes, AlphaGo 1 hour and 34 minutes.]
;B[ge]
;W[bg]C[Black's unyielding move at 49 aimed to swallow up all of the white stones, but White's hane at 50 left a great deal of bad aji for Black due to the shortage of liberties. Lee's expression at this moment was grim, and he sighed heavily. It seemed as if Black would have to compromise. See the variation.]
(;B[bh]
;W[be]
;B[af]C[The fight grew more complicated, but Lee appeared to be at a disadvantage. If White managed to get out, the game would be decided on the spot. In fact, things seemed to be heading in that direction.]
;W[df]C[White 54 is excellent move order.]
;B[ee]
;W[ed]
;B[fe]LB[ed:A][fe:B]C[After the exchange of A for B, many of the live commentaries had already discovered a problem for Black. See the variation.]
(;W[ag]C[Shockingly, at this moment AlphaGo chose to atari at 58, and White's group simply died! Had AlphaGo made another critical blunder?

Studying the data, I found that AlphaGo was not confused the way it had been in game 4. In fact, the win rate had barely changed at all. Of course, from the human perspective of seeking the best moves, AlphaGo's choice was a foolish one. From a global perspective, however, White is by no means behind, and as we will soon see, the dead stones are far from meaningless.

Regardless, Lee had just gone from hell to paradise. He looked as if he sensed another sudden reversal at hand. Perhaps this was the cause of his tremendous blunder just a few moves later.]
;B[dd]
;W[fq]C[White 60 was extremely large. We have already analyzed this move, and earlier it would have failed for White. However, due to the exchanges on the left side, Black's refutation no longer works! This may have been the compensation White was looking for by sacrificing the stones on the left.]
;B[fr]
;W[er]C[See the variation for what happens if Black tries to avoid being sealed in.]
(;B[dr]
;W[ep]
;B[dq]
;W[gr]
;B[es]
;W[gq]LB[bi:A][di:B]C[Up to here, White had reaped a large profit on the bottom. Black was completely sealed into the corner, while White had built a powerful formation on the outside. Considering that White's moves at A and B had also become sente, the thickness of the upper wall was almost perfect. AlphaGo may have missed the chance to wrap up the game, but on the whole White was not doing badly at all. At this point, AlphaGo's win rate had already climbed above 70%.

At the same time, Lee Sedol was equally pleased, still basking in the warm afterglow of Black's profits on the left.]
;B[mp]C[White’s aim to build up the bottom was clear, so Lee played the shoulder hit to reduce White's potential. Some commentators felt that this move went too deep, but AlphaGo would have made the same choice in Black's position.]
;W[mn]C[The cap was the only move to start the attack.]
;B[mq]
;W[np]
;B[mo]
;W[nn]
;B[ln]
;W[lm]
;B[kn]
;W[km]C[Up to 78, the battle intensified, seemingly heading towards a climactic life-and-death battle.]
(;B[kp]LB[km:B][lm:A]C[Unexpectedly, however, Lee hesitated. Instead of extending, he turned back towards safety, making an eye with 79. Should Black have risked the life of the group to extend out into the center? See the variation.

If Lee were to play ten games from this exact position, he would have played the extension in perhaps nine of them. After the game, he must have asked himself, when it would have been so much his style to seek life in the centre, how could he possibly have chosen to back down? There are no doubt many causes, but the sense of superiority born of Black's unexpected gains on the left side must be the main one.

Besides this, White's moves at A and B would have taken immense courage for a human to play. White would be in deep trouble if Black lived inside White's moyo, so a human player would experience great doubt and hesitation before attacking this way. In contrast, AlphaGo's constant, unfeeling rhythm can easily unnerve its opponents. This may well be the most difficult aspect of playing against AlphaGo.

Black 79 was perhaps the move that Lee regretted most from the entire match. If he had extended instead, would it have changed the outcome? Sadly, we will never know. The French have a proverb: "With enough 'ifs', one could fit Paris in a bottle."]
;W[jn]C[When White haned at 80, AlphaGo’s win rate climbed to 76%. Now the centre and left side would become White territory, and Black would have to make a painstaking life at the bottom.]
;B[jr]
;W[jp]
;B[jq]
;W[jo]
;B[ml]C[Lee Sedol suddenly realized his plight. With this jump, he attempted to reduce White's influence, but only achieved the opposite. ]
;W[nr]
;B[mm]
;W[no]
;B[lq]
;W[lk]LB[no:B][nr:A]C[Not only had White gained points while making life with A and B, but after White jumped here, it was plain to see that Black's two stones were facing the wrong direction. Truly, blessings do not come in pairs, and misfortunes never come singly.

At this moment, AlphaGo’s win rate was 84%. Lee had 46 minutes left, AlphaGo 1 hour and 9 minutes.

Just as I began to believe we would finally have a game come down to counting, Lee resigned at move 280. In that moment, he looked utterly helpless.

In the end, the result of the match was a 4-1 victory for AlphaGo.

It was an unforgettable story, this week of intense competition between man and machine. Even now, when I recall the scene, I am just overwhelmed by emotion as I was then. I believe the most important contribution of this match is not the result, but rather the opportunity it has given us to rethink our understanding of Go, and of ourselves.

I would like to finish this commentary with a quote from Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet, spoken at the press conference in Seoul before the match:

“The winner here, no matter what happens, is humanity."])
